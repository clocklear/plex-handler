# plex-handler
An experimental project leveraging Plex media server webhooks

The goal here for me is to create a webapp that will allow me to land Plex webhook calls, explore them in a simple UI, and perhaps rig up automation based on them. (perhaps dim my lights when a movie starts on a certain device?)

Very WIP.
